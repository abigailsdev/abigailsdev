# About me
Hi! My name is Abigail and I'm a student software developer from the United Kingdom who specialises in backend programming and command line utilities in Rust.

I am currently studying Games Technology and learning games development in Unity with C#.

## Experience
I am most confident in using Rust and prefer to use it over most other programming languages but I have also used C#, Ruby, Lua, Python, and C amongst a variety of others.

I also have experience with Linux system administration, Nginx, PHP (both from a sysadmin and programming perspective), and Common Gateway Interface.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is through my [professional email address](mailto:abigailsdev@proton.me).
